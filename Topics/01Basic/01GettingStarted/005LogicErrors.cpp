/*

Errors or bugs in your code that cause your program to run incorrectly.
Logic Errors are mistakes (careless mistakes, or sometimes the mistakes are if the programmer have incomplete or incorrect information) made by the programmer that cause a program to produce incorrect results.

// Example - Suppose we have a program that determines if a person can vote in an election and you must be 18 years or older to vote.

/* In below sample code, the condition shoulld be if (age >= 18) or if (age > 17)
As the program is now, it means that if you are 18, you cannot vote
*/

// if (age > 18) {
//   std::cout << "Yes, you can vote!";
// }
