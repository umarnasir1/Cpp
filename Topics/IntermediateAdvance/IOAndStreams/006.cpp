  Reading from a Text File
    Opening a file for reading with fstream
    Opening a file for reading with ifstream
    Opening a file for reading with open
      havent provided any file name to associate with it.
      Very common use case since many times we dont know the file name, and we have to get it from the user or from some other source at run time. Once we have the file name, we can use it and use open method on the stream object to open the file.

  Create the stream and connect it to a file.
  Read from the file - we have to be sure that the file is opened successfully -   May be it was not found or there was some sort of permission issue. Few ways to check that
      is_open()
        We can call the is open method of the file stream object that we created. This will return a boolean indicating whether the file is open for processing or not.
          true - then its OK and we can read fromt he file.
          false - something happened and we cant read from the file.
            We might then display an error message and terminate the program.
            We might see if we can somehow recreate that file from a backup.
      test the stream object
        true - we can proceed reading from the file
        false - if we couldnt open file

    Reading from file
      using >>
        We can use extraction operator for formatted read (from text file)
        same way we used it within cin
      using getline
        We can use getline to read the file one line at a time. (>> operator stops when they see any white space)
        to read all the lines in a file - reading text file one line at a time
      one character at a time (get)





    Closing file
      Always close any open files to flush out any unwritten data.

We can also embed statements that have the extraction operator in there. Since these statements return a reference to the stream object, they'll only return a true value when the read was successful. So when we reach the end of file or some other error condition is encountered, they will not return true, and the loop will terminate.

  // Reading text file one character at a time (get)

Sometimes this is very useful since the extraction operator getline and other methods depend on white space or new lines to be able to work correctly. Unformatted input reads one character at a time regardless of what that character is.
